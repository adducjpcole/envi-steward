        I took this picture right after waking up, the morning after a heavy rain. Frogs were croaking loudly and yet,
        the rain made the whole place feel calm and renewed. It reminded me how beautiful nature is when it's
        undisturbed and allowed to recover on its own.

        But, moments like these are becoming less common because of human activities. Deforestation, pollution, and
        rapid
        development slowly damage environments like the one in the photo. Heavy rains, which should nourish the land,
        sometimes become destructive because of poor drainage, clogged waterways, or lack of trees to absorb water. It
        shows how our actions directly affect natural systems.

        From this, I learnt that nature teaches resilience and balance. After a storm, it recovers
        with sort of a melancholic calmness. In the words of Paul McCartney, nature simply "lets it be". In my daily
        life, that means staying consistent, adapting when things get hard, and being more responsible with my choices.
        And, most importantly, small daily habits matter. If nature can renew itself after heavy rain, I can also reset
        and grow after challenges.
